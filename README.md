# plagiarism-detection
A simple Python project to detect plagiarism by comparing the content of two text files. This tool uses SequenceMatcher from the difflib library to calculate a similarity percentage, helping identify overlaps between the files. It also preprocesses the text by removing special characters and converting it to lowercase for accurate comparisons.
